# Find-Winner-on-a-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This problem (LeetCode 1275) was a great opportunity to learn how to handle multiple cases efficiently. I discovered how to use tuples and sets to simplify the logic and optimize the code. I also enhanced my ability to structure an algorithm to cover all potential outcomes (win, draw, pending) in a clear and organized manner.
